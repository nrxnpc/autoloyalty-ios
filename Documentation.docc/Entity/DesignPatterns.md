# Design Patterns

Core design patterns implemented in the AutoLoyalty domain model.

## Overview

The domain model implements several key design patterns from Domain-Driven Design to ensure maintainable, scalable, and business-focused code architecture.

## Implemented Patterns

### Entity Pattern
Domain objects with unique identity and mutable state:
- **Unique Identity**: All entities have stable `id` fields that persist throughout lifecycle
- **Mutable State**: Entities can change over time while maintaining identity
- **Equality**: Based on identity comparison, not state comparison
- **Examples**: User, Product, Car, Achievement

### Value Object Pattern
Immutable objects defined by their attributes:
- **Immutability**: Value objects represent concepts that don't change
- **Equality**: Based on all properties, not unique identifiers
- **No Identity**: Defined entirely by their attributes
- **Examples**: UserPreferences, CarSpecifications, PointTransaction

### Enumeration Pattern
Type-safe status and category management:
- **Type Safety**: Prevents invalid states through compile-time checking
- **Display Logic**: Each enum provides `displayName` and `color` for UI consistency
- **Business Rules**: Encapsulates valid state transitions and business logic
- **Examples**: UserRole, ProductCategory, OrderStatus, AchievementRarity

### Aggregate Pattern
Related objects grouped for consistency:
- **User Aggregate**: User + UserPreferences + UserStatistics
- **Achievement Aggregate**: Achievement + AchievementReward + progress tracking
- **Support Aggregate**: SupportTicket + SupportMessage collection
- **Consistency**: Ensures related objects remain in valid states

## Business Rules Enforcement

### Domain-Level Validation
- Points cannot be negative (User domain)
- Stock quantities must be non-negative (Product domain)
- Achievement progress cannot exceed requirements
- Transaction amounts must be positive

### Workflow Enforcement
- Order status transitions follow defined workflow
- Support ticket lifecycle management
- News article approval process
- Achievement unlock conditions

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions through UserRole enumeration
- Supplier-specific product management
- Admin-only system configuration

## Integration Benefits

### Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns between entities and value objects
- Encapsulated business logic within domain objects
- Type-safe enumerations prevent runtime errors

### Scalability
- Aggregate boundaries define consistency requirements
- Value objects enable efficient caching strategies
- Immutable objects support concurrent access patterns

### Testability
- Domain logic isolated from infrastructure concerns
- Value objects enable easy unit testing
- Enumeration patterns provide predictable behavior
