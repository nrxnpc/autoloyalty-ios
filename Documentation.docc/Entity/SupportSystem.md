# Support System

Value objects for customer service and communication management.

## Overview

Support system objects manage customer service interactions through structured ticket workflows. These value objects ensure efficient issue resolution and communication tracking.

## Value Objects

### SupportTicket
Customer service interaction tracking system:
- **Purpose**: Manage customer support requests from creation to resolution
- **Workflow**: Open → In Progress → Resolved → Closed
- **Priority**: Urgency classification for proper resource allocation
- **Communication**: Message thread management with role identification

#### TicketStatus
Service workflow states:
- `open`: New ticket awaiting assignment
- `inProgress`: Actively being worked on
- `resolved`: Issue addressed, awaiting confirmation
- `closed`: Ticket completed and archived

#### Priority
Urgency classification system:
- `low`: Non-critical issues, standard response time
- `medium`: Moderate impact, elevated priority
- `high`: Significant impact, urgent attention required
- `urgent`: Critical issues requiring immediate response

### SupportMessage
Individual communication within support tickets:
- **Purpose**: Track all communication within support context
- **Immutability**: Messages cannot be modified after creation
- **Identity**: Sender role identification (customer, support, admin)
- **Attachments**: File attachment support for comprehensive communication

## Business Rules

- Tickets cannot skip workflow states
- Priority determines response time requirements
- Messages are immutable once created
- Role-based access controls message visibility
- Closed tickets can be reopened if needed
